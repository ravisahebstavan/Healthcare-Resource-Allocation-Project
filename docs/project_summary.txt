# HOSPITAL READMISSION PREDICTION - PROJECT SUMMARY
================================================================

## Dataset
- Total Records: 101,766
- Features: 52
- Target: Early readmission (<30 days)
- Class Balance: 11.16% readmitted

## Models Trained
1. Logistic Regression (Baseline): AUC = 0.6522
2. XGBoost: AUC = 0.6806
3. LightGBM: AUC = 0.6857

## Best Model
- Model: LightGBM
- Validation AUC: 0.6857
- Test AUC: 0.6759
- F1-Score: 0.2755

## Key Accomplishments
[DONE] Complete ML pipeline from raw data to deployed model
